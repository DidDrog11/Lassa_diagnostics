Y. and Uhunmwangho, J.","Background & objectives:√äLassa fever has been endemic in Nigeria since 1969. The rodent√äMastomys natalensis√ähas been widely claimed to be the reservoir host of the Lassa virus. This study was designed to investigate the distribution of species of rodents in three states (Edo, Delta and Bayelsa) of Nigeria and to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus amongst trapped rodents in the selected states.√äMethods:Rodents were trapped during November 2015 to October 2016 from the three states in South-South region of Nigeria. Total RNA was extracted from the blood collected from the trapped rodents. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the presence of Lassa virus in the rodents.√äResults:√äThe results revealed that six species of rodents were predominantly present in these geographical locations.√äMus musculus√ä(39.4%) had the highest prevalence, closely followed by√äRattus rattus√ä(36.1%),√äR. fuscipus(20.3%),√äM. natalensis√ä(2%),√äMyosoricinae soricidae√ä(1.2%) and√äR. norvegicus√ä(1%). The overall positivity (carrier rate) of Lassa virus was 1.6% amongst the 1500 rodents caught in the three states. In Edo and Delta States, the RT-PCR results showed presence of Lassa virus in√äR rattus, M. musculus√äand√äM. natalensis. On the other hand, only√äM. natalensis√äwas detected with the virus, amongst the species of rodents caught in Bayelsa State.√äM. natalensis√ärecorded the highest Lassa virus among rodents trapped in Edo (87%), Delta (50%) and Bayelsa (11%) States respectively.√äInterpretation & conclusion:√äThe rather low Lassa virus positive among rodents in Bayelsa State of Nigeria may explain the absence of reports of outbreak of Lassa fever over the past 48 yr in the state. The results also confirmed that apart from√äMastomys natalensis, other rodents such as√äRattus rattus√äand√äMus musculus√ämay also serve as reservoirs for Lassa virus. From the findings of this cross-sectional study, it was concluded that a more comprehensive study on rodents as reservoir host, need to be undertaken across the entire states of Nigeria, for better understanding of the epidemiology and endemicity of Lassa fever.",Include,Include,Include,3
The structure of rodent faunas associated with arenaviral infections,1975,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Arata, A. A. and Gratz, N. G.","The biogeographical examination of rodent faunas associated with arenaviruses reveals two distinct patterns. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus is associated primarily with a single murid species, Mus musculus, although it is also known to cause laboratory infections in other species. On the other hand, the arenaviruses from the Western hemisphere are associated exclusively with a large and diverse group of cricetid rodents. Studies to date, although limited, have not demonstrated their association with any other rodent groups, although in South America alone at least twelve other rodent families are known. Evidence at the present time indicates that Lassa virus is only associated with a common African rodent, Mastomy natalensis. From this limited evidence it is as yet difficult to determine whether Lassa virus will follow the pattern of the South American arenaviruses, most of which are known from several species of rodents, or that of LCM virus, which appears to be associated with only a single rodent species. In this paper, the history and structure of South American, Eurasian, and African rodent faunas are described.",Exclude,Maybe,Include,>1

H.","Lassa virus (LASV), a mammarenavirus, infects an estimated 100,000√ê300,000 individuals yearly in western Africa and frequently causes lethal disease. Currently, no LASV-specific antivirals or vaccines are commercially available for prevention or treatment of Lassa fever, the disease caused by LASV. The development of medical countermeasure screening platforms is a crucial step to yield licensable products. Using reverse genetics, we generated a recombinant wild-type LASV (rLASV-WT) and a modified version thereof encoding a cleavable green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter for rapid and quantitative detection of infection (rLASV-GFP). Both rLASV-WT and wild-type LASV exhibited similar growth kinetics in cultured cells, whereas growth of rLASV-GFP was slightly impaired. GFP reporter expression by rLASV-GFP remained stable over several serial passages in Vero cells. Using two well-characterized broad-spectrum antivirals known to inhibit LASV infection, favipiravir and ribavirin, we demonstrate that rLASV-GFP is a suitable screening tool for the identification of LASV infection inhibitors. Building on these findings, we established a rLASV-GFP-based high-throughput drug discovery screen and an rLASV-GFP-based antibody neutralization assay. Both platforms, now available as a standard tool at the IRF-Frederick (an international resource), will accelerate anti-LASV medical countermeasure discovery and reduce costs of antiviral screens in maximum containment laboratories.",Exclude,Maybe,Include,>1

In this study, we vaccinated groups of strain 13 guinea pigs two times, four weeks apart with 50 mg of each DNA vaccine or a mock vaccine at discrete sites by intradermal electroporation. Five weeks following the second vaccinations, guinea pigs were exposed to lethal doses of Lassa virus, Ebola virus, or a combination of both viruses simultaneously. None of the vaccinated guinea pigs, regardless of challenge virus and including the coinfected group, displayed weight loss, fever or other disease signs, and all survived to the study endpoint. All of the mock-vaccinated guinea pigs that were infected with Lassa virus, and all but one of the EBOV-infected mock-vaccinated guinea pigs succumbed. In order to determine if the dual-agent vaccination strategy could protect against both viruses if exposures were temporally separated, we held the surviving vaccinates in BSL-4 for approximately 120 days to perform a cross-challenge experiment in which guinea pigs originally infected with Lassa virus received a lethal dose of Ebola virus and those originally infected with Ebola virus were infected with a lethal dose of Lassa virus. All guinea pigs remained healthy and survived to the study endpoint.

Zoonotic aspects of arenavirus infections,2010,Veterinary Microbiology,"Charrel, R. N. and de Lamballerie, X.","To date, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses recognizes that the family Arenaviridae contains a unique genus Arenavirus that includes 22 viral species. There are nine additional arenaviruses that either have been discovered recently, or which taxonomic status remains pending. Arenaviruses have been classified according to their antigenic properties into two groups, the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex which has been further divided into four evolutionary lineages. Each arenavirus is more or less tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of the host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become infected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected rodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent excreta and secreta. Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia viruses are known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, in western Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil, respectively. Infection by LCM virus can result in acute central nervous system disease, congenital malformations, and infection in organ transplantation recipients. Detection of arenaviruses in their animal host can be achieved by virus isolation, and has recently taken advantage of PCR-based techniques. The approach based on consensus degenerate primers has shown efficient for both detection of known arenaviruses, and discovery of new arenaviruses. √Ç¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

E.","Two Old World rodents, house mice (Mus musculus) and Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), were introduced into and established populations on every continent, save Antarctica. With their travels, they concomitantly introduced several zoonotic agents capable of causing human diseases. Two viruses-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; genus Arenavirus with mice) and Seoul virus (SEOV; genus Hantavirus with rats)-can cause chronic infections within their respective rodent hosts, resulting in persistent or life-long sporadic shedding of virus through secreta and excreta. Although the prevalence of infection within their wild rodent hosts can exceed 25% among mice infected with LCMV and 50% among rats infected with SEOV, acute human disease resulting from direct transmission from wild rodents is rarely reported even though both species live in close coexistence with humans. The usual ""classic"" zoonotic cycle of transmission from wild rodent reservoirs to humans now includes multiple unusual/unexpected routes. The largest described outbreaks of human disease caused by these viruses are linked to pet rodents. A novel reservoir host, the golden hamster, has supplanted house mice as the major source of LCMV infection, and SEOV outbreaks are linked to fancy rats kept as pets. Following LCMV, and to a lesser extent SEOV, outbreaks or infections associated with lab animals and/or cultured tissues derived from mice and hamsters have led to hundreds of cases of LCMV among laboratory workers, and SEOV has been detected among cell-cultured tissues. Additionally, LCMV is now a recognized source of severe congenital disease and is the unexpected source of severe and often fatal disease among solid organ recipients. Although the extensive usual and unusual routes of LCMV infection are exceptional there are many parallels with SEOV emergence.",Exclude,Include,Maybe,>1
Quadrivalent VesiculoVax vaccine protects nonhuman primates from viral-induced hemorrhagic fever and death,2019,The Journal of clinical investigation.,"Cross, R. W.","Recent occurrences of filoviruses and the arenavirus Lassa virus (LASV) in overlapping endemic areas of Africa highlight the need for a prophylactic vaccine that would confer protection against all of these viruses that cause lethal hemorrhagic fever (HF). We developed a quadrivalent formulation of VesiculoVax that contains recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vectors expressing filovirus glycoproteins and that also contains a rVSV vector expressing the glycoprotein of a lineage IV strain of LASV. Cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated twice with the quadrivalent formulation, followed by challenge 28 days after the boost vaccination with each of the 3 corresponding filoviruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg) or a heterologous contemporary lineage II strain of LASV. Serum IgG and neutralizing antibody responses specific for all 4 glycoproteins were detected in all vaccinated animals. A modest and balanced cell-mediated immune response specific for the glycoproteins was also detected in most of the vaccinated macaques. Regardless of the level of total glycoprotein-specific immune response detected after vaccination, all immunized animals were protected from disease and death following lethal challenges. These findings indicate that vaccination with attenuated rVSV vectors each expressing a single HF virus glycoprotein may provide protection against those filoviruses and LASV most commonly responsible for outbreaks of severe HF in Africa.",Exclude,Include,Exclude,>1

The high frequency of neoplastic and degenerative diseases observed among older animals in closed colonies of M. natalensis were not observed in the wild animals studied. This is probably a reflection of the age distribution of the study population, since the life expectancy of wild Mastomys is less than a year. Inflammatory lesions were nonetheless identified, some of which were similar to those described in laboratory colonies. Frequent lesions were myocarditis (54%), myositis (32%), interstitial pneumonitis (50%), intercapillary glomerulosclerosis (36%), and acute nephrosis (14%). Follicular and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia were evident in the spleen (74%) and Peyer's patches (64%). Lymphoid cell accumulations were prominent in the salivary glands (36%), periportal hepatic region (25%), lungs (32%), perivascular regions (36%), and kidney (21%). Cytomegalic inclusion body sialoadenitis was common (25%). Coccidiosis was evident in the intestinal tract (25%), kidney (25%), and muscle (21%). One neoplasm, a parahepatic haemangioma, was observed histologically. Mean body weights and lengths for virus positive animals (33 g and 9.2 cm) and virus negative animals (54 g and 12.2 cm) showed that virus positive animals were smaller in weight and shorter in length. Since the age of the animals could not be determined, these differences remain unexplained.

Virus isolation from spleen homogenates was also performed on a subset of animals. Lassa antibody and antigen were found in 96 (11%) and 46 (5%), respectively, of 884 tested Mastomys. Antibody and antigen were essentially mutually exclusive and showed profiles consistent with vertical transmission of both LV and antibody. LV was isolated only from Mastomys. ELISA antigen constituted an acceptable surrogate for virus isolation, with a sensitivity and specificity when performed on blood of 78% (95% confidence interval: 68-83%) and 98% (95-99%), respectively. The proportion of LV-infected Mastomys per region ranged from 0 to 9% and was highest in the savannah and forest zones.

In addition to high case fatality rates, arenaviruses have many features that enhance their potential as bioweapons. Arenaviruses have relatively stable virions, do not require passage via insect vectors, are transmitted easily by human-to-human contact and can be spread by simple means of dispersal. The ease of travel to and from endemic areas also permits easy access to LASV and other arenaviruses for use as bioweapons. A cluster of hemorrhagic fever cases in the United States caused by any arenavirus would be a major public health incident. The potential use of arenaviruses as biological weapons directed against civilian or military targets necessitates development of effective commercial diagnostics. The ultimate goal of our project is to develop and validate multiagent diagnostic immunoassays for arenaviruses using recombinant antigens. These assays can be used to determine the attack agent following a deliberate release, and allow the virus used to be distinguished from other hemorrhagic fever viruses, such as dengue virus or Ebola virus, that may have similar case presentations.

Previously, we demonstrated by PCR screening that only the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, hosts Lassa virus in Guinea. In the present study, we used the same specimen collection from 17 villages in Coastal, Upper, and Forest Guinea to investigate the Lassa virus serology in the rodent population. The aim was to determine the dynamics of antibody development in M. natalensis and to detect potential spillover infections in other rodent species. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody screening was performed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay with the Guinean Lassa virus strain Bantou 289 as antigen. The overall seroprevalence was 8% (129/1551) with the following rodents testing positive: 109 M. natalensis, seven Mastomys erythroleucus, four Lemniscomys striatus, four Praomys daltoni, three Mus minutoides, and two Praomys rostratus. Nearly all of them (122/129) originated from Bantou, Tanganya, and Gbetaya, where Lassa virus is highly endemic in M. natalensis. The antibody seroprevalence in M. natalensis from this high-endemic area (27%; 108/396) depended on the village, habitat, host age, and host abundance. A main positive factor was age; the maximum seroprevalence reached 50% in older animals. Our data fit with a model implicating that most M. natalensis rodents become horizontally infected, clear the virus within a period significantly shorter than their life span, and develop antibodies. In addition, the detection of antibodies in other species trapped in the habitats of M. natalensis suggests spillover infections.

Lassa virus (LASV) has a rodent reservoir Mastomys natalensis, and is transmitted to humans through direct contact, their body fluids or droppings. According to a mathematical model, the correlation between the reservoir abundance and viral prevalence in the reservoir can show 4 scenarios: (1) positive linear, (2) positive logarithmic with a threshold, (3) negative or (4) null. Consequently, the correlation between reservoir abundance and force of infection to humans can be: (1) positive exponential, (2) positive linear with a threshold, (3) null or (4) positive linear. Aim We therefore intended to investigate 3 outcome variables: rodent abundance, LASV prevalence in the rodent population and recent Lassa cases in humans, by conducting an experimental study in a high endemic zone in Upper Guinea, Guinea. Methods In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 the rodent populations were sampled in 4-10 villages, all located in remote dry forest savannah. In 3 villages, the rodent populations were reduced by using anticoagulant once a year; and the level of abundance was checked before and after control. Necropsies were done each day in situ following the BSL3 procedure, and the blood was collected on filter papers. LASV testing was done with a double PCR targeted on S and L segments. In 2014, the human population was randomly sampled in 6 villages. Serology on human sera was performed by using ELISA and IFA tests. Results In total, 1030 rodents were collected of which 954 were M. natalensis. Their abundance, measured by the mean trapping success varied from 1.1% to 16.7%. LASV prevalence varied from 0.0% to 33.3%. First analysis showed no relationship between rodent abundance and Lassa prevalence (scenario 4). Nevertheless, the relationship between rodent abundance and force of infection was positively correlated (r = 0.56, n= 31, P=0.001) according to the mathematical model. Of 1306 human sera, 993 were IgG positive and 23 IgM positive. Conclusion The Lassa incidence in humans could be amplified when rodent populations remain abundant.",Include,Include,Include,3
Rapid detection of Lassa virus by reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification,NA,Microbiology & Immunology,"Fukuma, A. and Kurosaki, Y. and Morikawa, Y. and Grolla, A. and Feldmann, H. and Yasuda, J.","In this study, a simple one-step reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for rapid detection of Lassa virus (LASV) was established. The two primer sets were designed to detect LASV circulating in Sierra Leone and northeastern Nigeria. The RT-LAMP assay using these primer sets was able to detect 100 copies of the√äin vitrotranscribed artificial LASV RNA within 25 min. The assay was also evaluated using intact viral RNA extracted from cell culture-propagated viruses and confirmed to be highly specific for LASV. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study is rapid, simple, and highly specific for the detection of LASV, although its sensitivity is slightly lower than that of real-time RT-PCR. In addition, because the RT-LAMP assay does not require the use of sophisticated equipment, it would be advantageous for clinical diagnosis of LASV infection in developing countries.

Serological assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers,2012,Viruses,"Fukushi, S. and Tani, H. and Yoshikawa, T. and Saijo, M. and Morikawa, S.","The family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus, consists of two phylogenetically independent groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) complexes. The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Chapare viruses in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically in order to minimize the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL-4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL-4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems in the form of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and Junin viruses were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by arenaviruses. √Ç¬© 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Exclude,Exclude,Include,>1
DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELISA SYSTEM FOR THE DETECTION AND STRAIN IDENTIFICATION OF LASSA AND EBOLA VIRUSES USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES,1983,NA,"Getchell, Jane Pentl","An ELISA was developed which was able to detect Lassa and Ebola virus antigens in supernatant fluids from infected Vero cells and in animal sera, using monoclonal antibodies. Plaque infectivity titers in these fluids were as low as 10('3) PFU/ml, a level of virus comparable to that found in the blood of infected patients. By selecting a monoclonal antibody specific for the VP3 protein of Ebola mayinga, and a second monoclonal antibody specific for the VP3 protein of E. boniface, these two strains of Ebola virus could be distinguished. Beads coated with antibody by amination and diazotization, and by a second method using a carboiimide reagent and a commercially prepared kit (Bio-Rad), were found to be less satisfactory in capturing viral antigen than immobilizing antigen in filter paper disks contained in the wells of a specially designed 96-well filtration manifold. No difference in test sensitivity was observed when antigen was immobilized in filter paper compared to antigen bound directly to the walls of 96-well microelisa plates. The use of polyclonal capture antibody to trap test antigen served only to increase test background, not test sensitivity. When the test was applied to blood and tissues from experimental animals infected with Lassa or Ebola virus, Lassa josiah antigen was reliably detected in specimens containing more than 10('7) PFU/ml. Experiments were conducted to explore reasons for this loss of sensitivity, but no definite conclusions could be made. Results suggest that E. mayinga antigen was detected in a formalin-inactivated guinea pig serum originally containing 10('3.17) PFU/ml, but not in a duplicate serum inactivated by gamma irradiation. Attempts were made to develop a competitive binding ELISA for Ebola antigen in which the antibody in known antibody-containing sera was reacted with the solid-phase Ebola antigen (either purified virus or whole Ebola-infected Vero cells). Monoclonal antibody was then added to determine if the antibody binding sites on the viral antigen had been blocked by serum antibodies.

Strand-specific quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for measurement of arenavirus genomic and antigenomic RNAs,2015,PLoS ONE,"Haist, K. and Ziegler, C. and Botten, J.","Arenaviruses are bi-segmented, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The manner in which they regulate the replication of their genome is not well-understood. This is partly due to the absence of a highly sensitive assay to measure individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for selective quantitation of each of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) genomic or antigenomic RNAs. During the course of assay design, we identified a nonspecific priming phenomenon whereby, in the absence of an RT primer, cDNAs complementary to each of the LCMV replicative RNA species are generated during RT. We successfully circumvented this nonspecific priming event through the use of biotinylated primers in the RT reaction, which permitted affinity purification of primer-specific cDNAs using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As proof of principle, we used the assay to map the dynamics of LCMV replication at acute and persistent time points and to determine the quantities of genomic and antigenomic RNAs that are incorporated into LCMV particles. This assay can be adapted to measure total S or L segment-derived viral RNAs and therefore represents a highly sensitive diagnostic platform to screen for LCMV infection in rodent and human tissue samples and can also be used to quantify viruscell attachment.

M.","Lassa fever (LF) is a zoonotic disease associated with acute and potentially fatal hemorrhagic illness caused by the Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the family√äArenaviridae. It is generally assumed that a single infection with LASV will produce life-long protective immunity. This suggests that protective immunity induced by vaccination is an achievable goal and that cell-mediated immunity may play a more important role in protection, at least following natural infection. Seropositive individuals in endemic regions have been shown to have LASV-specific T cells recognizing epitopes for nucleocapsid protein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC), suggesting that these will be important vaccine immunogens. The role of neutralizing antibodies in protective immunity is still equivocal as recent studies suggest a role for neutralizing antibodies. There is extensive genetic heterogeneity among LASV strains that is of concern in the development of assays to detect and identify all four LASV lineages. Furthermore, the gene disparity may complicate the synthesis of effective vaccines that will provide protection across multiple lineages. Non-human primate models of LASV infection are considered the gold standard for recapitulation of human LF. The most promising vaccine candidates to date are the ML29 (a live attenuated reassortant of Mopeia and LASV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and vaccinia-vectored platforms based on their ability to induce protection following single doses, high rates of survival following challenge, and the use of live virus platforms.

For many parasite species however this paradigm has not been tested, and conflicting results have been found regarding the effect of arenaviruses on their rodent host species. The rodent Mastomys natalensis is the natural reservoir host of several arenaviruses, including Lassa virus that is known to cause Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans. Here, we examined the effect of three arenaviruses (Gairo, Morogoro and Lassa virus) on four parameters of wild-caught Mastomys natalensis: body mass, head-body length, sexual maturity and fertility. After correcting for the effect of age, we compared these parameters between arenavirus-positive (arenavirus RNA or antibody) and negative animals using data from different field studies in Guinea (Lassa virus) and Tanzania (Morogoro and Gairo viruses). Result(s): Although the sample sizes of our studies (1297, 749 and 259 animals respectively) were large enough to statistically detect small differences in body conditions, we did not observe any adverse effects of these viruses on Mastomys natalensis. We did find that sexual maturity was significantly positively related with Lassa virus antibody presence until a certain age, and with Gairo virus antibody presence in general. Gairo virus antibody-positive animals were also significantly heavier and larger than antibody-free animals. Conclusion(s): Together, these results suggest that the pathogenicity of arenaviruses is not severe in M. natalensis, which is likely to be an adaptation of these viruses to optimize transmission success. They also suggest that sexual behaviour might increase the probability of M. natalensis to become infected with arenaviruses. Copyright √Ç¬© 2017 The Author(s).",Include,Include,Include,3

An estimated 37.7 million people are at risk of contracting LASV; therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe, effective vaccine against LASV infection. The LF endemic countries are also inflicted with HIV, Ebola, and malaria infections. The safety in immunocompromised populations must be considered in LASV vaccine development. The novel adenovirus vector-based platform, Ad5 (E1-,E2b-) has been used in clinical trial protocols for treatment of immunocompromised individuals, has been shown to exhibit high stability, low safety risk in humans, and induces a strong cell-mediated and pro-inflammatory immune response even in the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity. To this nature, our lab has developed an Ad5 (E1-,E2b-) vector-based vaccine expressing the LASV-NP or LASV-GPC. We found that guinea pigs vaccinated with two doses of Ad5 (E1-,E2b-) LASV-NP and Ad5 (E1-,E2b-) LASV-GPC were protected against lethal LASV challenge. The Ad5 (E1-,E2b-) LASV-NP and LASV-GPC vaccine represents a potential vaccine candidate against LF. Copyright √Ç¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Exclude,Include,Exclude,>1
A prospective study of the epidemiology and ecology of Lassa fever,1987,Journal of Infectious Diseases,"McCormick, J. B. and Webb, P. A. and Krebs, J.

Viral infection of Mastomys from houses ranged from 0% to 80%. The incidence of seroconversions in susceptible persons ranged from 5% to 22% per year; the ratio of illness to infection ranged from 9% to 26%, and the proportion of febrile illness associated with seroconversion was 5%-14%. Eightfold rises in titer of antibody occurred in 1%-18% of the antibody-positive population, a result suggesting reinfection. We estimate the ratio of fatalities to infection to be 1%-2%, a rate lower than estimates based on hospitalized cases.

G.","Lassa fever is a severe hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, which is transmitted to humans primarily by contact with the excreta or blood of Mastomys rodents. Current recommendations to reduce Mastomys abundance in homes include improved food storage and removal of rodents by trapping or poison. It is unknown if house construction influences Mastomys infestation or if improved house construction is an effective control. For this study, two villages (<100 houses) and two towns (>200 houses) were sampled during the dry season in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, an area of high Lassa fever incidence. Household features including construction type and refuse location were documented, and knowledge of Lassa fever was assessed in one resident per household. To date, 142 houses have been sampled 102 in villages, where all homes were included, and 40 in towns, where homes were sampled in two transects along the town perimeter. Three of the study sites had a laboratory-confirmed case of Lassa fever within two weeks prior to site visit, and rodent tissue was collected for further studies. A total of 224 small mammals were trapped in 2,909 trap nights (overall trap success [TS]=7.7%), including 162 M. natalensis (M. natalensis TS=5.6%), 55 Rattus, 6 Crocidura, and 1 Mus. Absolute number and TS of M. natalensis was similar between villages and towns. In a linear regression model, Mastomys-specific TS was correlated with the number of rodent burrows observed in homes (t=2.62, p=0.01). Wall and roof type were not associated with M. natalensis TS, however, type of floor construction did approach significance (t=-1.84, p=0.068). This relationship may be elucidated as we accrue a larger sample size in this ongoing study. Mastomys are burrowing rodents and the number of burrows observed may serve as a rapid indicator of Mastomys abundance and Lassa fever risk, as suggested by previous investigators. The ability of Mastomys to burrow in dirt floors may determine their capacity to infest houses, and promotion of cement floors may be a valuable control measure.",Include,Exclude,Maybe,>1
Detection of Lassa virus antigens and Lassa virus-specific immunoglobulins G and M by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,1984,Journal of Clinical Microbiology,"Niklasson, B. S. and Jahrling, P. B. and Peters, C. J.","Rapid diagnosis of Lassa fever is desirable for the timely therapeutic intervention and implementation of strict quarantine procedures both in West Africa field hospitals where the disease is endemic and at international crossroads. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure Lassa virus antigens in viremic sera was developed in which experimentally infected monkeys were used as a model for the human disease. In this test, Lassa virus antigens in test sera were captured in wells of microtiter plates by monkey anti-Lassa virus immunoglobulin. Guinea pig anti-Lassa virus immunoglobulin was then added, and binding of specific immunoglobulin was quantitated by the addition of rabbit anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin followed by alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. This test detected viremia titers as low as 2.1 log<inf>10</inf> PFU/ml in experimentally infected monkey sera, a titer often exceeded in patients with Lassa fever. Inactivation of infectious virus by beta-propiolactone or gamma-irradiation did not diminish reactivity. Antigen-ELISA concentrations increased with infectivity for the first 10 days after infection but then declined while infectivity titers remained high, suggesting that the presence of humoral antibody in viremic sera diminishes the sensitivity of the antigen ELISA. Lassa virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers measured in an IgM capture ELISA were detectable within 10 days of infection and peaked after 36 days but remained detectable for 1.5 years. The Lassa virus-specific IgG ELISA response was slightly delayed, peaking on day 73 but declining only slightly thereafter. These studies in a realistic primate model suggest that the antigen detection ELISA or the IgM capture ELISA described, in which beta-propiolactone-inactivated sera are used, should be useful for the rapid diagnosis of human Lassa fever.",Include,Include,Exclude,>1

C.","Rodents serve as reservoirs and/or vectors for several human infections which account for high morbidity and mortality in Africa. The remarkable expansion of human population has brought them into increasing contact with these mammals, thereby disrupting their habitats and increasing opportunities for disease transmission. To investigate possible risk factors for exposure to some of these pathogens, 764 small mammals were collected from ten communities in Ghana together with 657 human sera from healthy adults living in the same communities. Rodents were captured by setting Sherman collapsible traps along marked lines in fields (outdoors) and houses (indoors) totaling 9,269 night traps for three consecutive nights. The small mammals caught constituted ten genera of which whole blood of two rodents (0.3%) Mus (Nannomys) sp. tested positive for arenaviruses and one kidney tissue from Croccidura sp tested positive for Leptospira by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All rodent lung tissues were negative for Hantaviruses (Dobrava and Puumala serotypes). Using an in-house enzyme-immunoassay (ELISA), human serum showed evidence of arenavirus antibodies in 34 samples (5%). Antibodies to Puumala and Dobrava serotypes and Leptospirosis were also detected in 11%, 12% and 21% respectively with commercial kits. The occurrence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Dobrava and Puumala serotypes was more common in females (54%) than in males whereas the opposite was observed for Lassa virus (LASV) and Leptospirosis (52%). Human exposure to zoonotic infections was observed to cut across all age groups. Seropositivity was highest for anti-LASV at site 7 (29%), anti-hantavirus (Dobrava serotype) at site 10 (26%), and anti-Leptospira at site 8 (19%) located in the Eastern, Brong Ahafo, and Northern Regions respectively. Fifty six individuals had been exposed to more than one of the rodentborne infections tested whereas 208 had been exposed to only one type of infection. The known reservoirs of the different pathogens that were tested in the human sera were captured in most of the study sites but human exposure could not be linked to their presence. This study suggests that 40% of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one rodent-borne disease (LASV, hantavirus, or Leptospirosis), which is not surprising given the ubiquitous presence of rodents in subsistence farming communities.",Include,Include,Include,3

Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus (LASV) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for IgG antibodies and incorporating previous PCR detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Method(s): Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoors, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). Identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by DNA sequencing. Small mammals were tested for LASV IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Result(s): Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species IgG-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be PCR-positive (n = 3). IgG-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either PCR or IgG in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled. IgG prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1% in Abagboro, 17-36 % in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 % in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusion(s): Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. Further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.

The LASV-rNP was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. LASV-rNP was used as an antigen in the detection of LASV-antibodies and as an immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The LASV-rNP was also expressed in HeLa cells by transfection with the expression vector encoding cDNA of the LASV-NP gene. An immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using LASV-rNP and an indirect immunofluorescence assay using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells were confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LASV-antibodies. A novel monoclonal antibody to LASV-rNP, monoclonal antibody 4A5, was established. A sandwich antigen capture (Ag-capture) ELISA using the monoclonal antibody and an anti-LASV-rNP rabbit serum as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, was then developed. Authentic LASV nucleoprotein in serum samples collected from hamsters experimentally infected with LASV was detected by the Ag-capture ELISA. The Ag-capture ELISA specifically detected LASV-rNP but not the rNPs of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Junin virus. The sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA in detecting LASV antigens was comparable to that of reverse transcription-PCR in detecting LASV RNA. These LASV rNP-based diagnostics were confirmed to be useful in the diagnosis of LF even in institutes without a high containment laboratory, since the antigens can be prepared without manipulation of the infectious viruses.

One such technology is the Luminex MagPix platform using xMAP microspheres. Here, we compare the MagPix platform with a traditional ELISA for IgM and antigen detection of infections from Lassa and Ebola viruses (LASV and EBOV, respectively). For IgM detection in nonhuman primate samples, the MagPix platform was 5 and 25 times more sensitive in detecting LASV and EBOV, respectively, compared to that with ELISA.

Use of monoclonal antibody for the detection of Lassa virus antibody and antigen in patients with Lassa fever,1986,Medical Microbiology and Immunology,"Schmitz, H. and Wolf, H. R.","Monoclonal antibodies to numerous epitopes of Lassa virus (LV) (strain Josiah) were obtained in our high security laboratory after immunization of BALB/c mice with infected mouse brain. The antibodies had been selected by indirect immunofluorescence procedure using acetone-fixed Vero cells infected with LV [3]. After recloning, 14 LVspecific hybridomas were obtained. The monoclonals were characterized by radioimmune precipitation using 35 S-methionine-labelled LV proteins, and were found to be directed at the glycoprotein G2 and the nucleocapsid antigen [ 1]. A cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies was employed in a double-labelling procedure to control the demonstration of anti-LV antibodies in human sera. By the use of rhodamine-labelled anti-mouse immunoglobulin and fluoresceine-labelled antihuman immunglobulin antisera specific staining could be clearly differentiated from nonspecific fluorescence obtained with many human sera at low dilutions. Further experiments were carried out to detect LV antigen in human serum samples. The monoclonal antibodies were isolated from cell culture fluids and labelled with peroxidase; they were then employed in our enzyme immunoassay which measures adherence of immune complexes to rheumatoid factor (RF) bound to a solid phase [2]. For this, different quantities of mouse brain or Vero cell antigen were mixed with human serum having an anti-LV titer of > 2,000 as determined by indirect immunofluorescence procedure. This antigen-antibody mixture was incubated overnight with RF fixed to the surfaces of microtiter plates. The immune complexes sticking to the RFcoated plates were then detected by adherence of peroxidase-labelled monoclonal antibody during further incubation for 3 h. The results were compared with the results obtained by a conventional sandwich enzyme immunoassay in which the solid phase had been coated with monoclonal antibody and bound antigen was revealed by use of additional peroxidase-labelled monoclonal antibody. Evaluation disclosed that about 10 ng of antigen could be detected with both methods. In a further experiment LV antigen was added to 10% human serum to mimic the conditions under which it is found in sera from patients. In the presence of 10% human serum the RF test turned out to be significantly more sensitive than the sandwich test.",Include,Exclude,Exclude,>1

Diagnostics play a crucial role in epidemic preparedness. This systematic review was conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Lassa fever diagnostic tests for humans. Method(s): We searched OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Scopus and Web of Science for laboratory based and field studies that reported the performance of diagnostic tests for Lassa fever in humans from 1 January 1990 to 25 January 2019. Two reviewers independently screened all the studies and included only studies that involved the evaluation of a Lassa fever diagnostic test and provided data on the sensitivity and specificity. The quality of the studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 criteria. Data on the study location, study design, type of sample, index test, reference tests and diagnostic performance were extracted from the studies. Result(s): Out of a total of 1947 records identified, 1245 non-duplicate citations were obtained. Twenty-six (26) full-text articles examined which identified 08 studies meeting pre-defined criteria. Only one study was a field evaluation study. The sensitivity and specificity of the point of care (RDT) against the Nikisins qPCR were 91.2%(95% CI:75.2-97.7) and 86%(95% CI: 71.4-94.2) at temperatures 18-30 degreeC, while the sensitivity and specificity of the single IgM ELISA assay against standard RT-PCR were 31.1%(95%CI: 25.6-37) and 95.7%(95%CI:92.8-97.7). The sensitivity of the combined ELISA Antigen/IgM assay(against virus isolation), the recombinant IgM/IgG ELISA(against standard RT-PCR), and the IgM/IgG immunoblot(against IFA) were 88%(95%CI:77-95), 25.9%(95%CI:20.8-31.6), and 90.7%(95%CI:84.13-97.27) respectively.

"Short report: Comprehensive panel of real-time TaqManTM polymerase chain reaction assays for detection and absolute quantification of filoviruses, arenaviruses, and new world hantaviruses",2010,American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,"Trombley, A. R. and Wachter, L. and Garrison, J. and Buckley-Beason, V. A. and Jahrling, J. and Hensley, L. E. and Schoepp, R. J. and Norwood, D. A. and Goba, A. and Fair, J. N. and Kulesh, D. A.","Viral hemorrhagic fever is caused by a diverse group of single-stranded, negative-sense or positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the families Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg), Arenaviridae (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Guanarito), and Bunyaviridae (hantavirus). Disease characteristics in these families mark each with the potential to be used as a biological threat agent. Because other diseases have similar clinical symptoms, specific laboratory diagnostic tests are necessary to provide the differential diagnosis during outbreaks and for instituting acceptable quarantine procedures. We designed 48 TaqManTM-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for specific and absolute quantitative detection of multiple hemorrhagic fever viruses. Forty-six assays were determined to be virus-specific, and two were designated as pan assays for Marburg virus. The limit of detection for the assays ranged from 10 to 0.001 plaque-forming units (PFU)/PCR. Although these real-time hemorrhagic fever virus assays are qualitative (presence of target), they are also quantitative (measure a single DNA/RNA target sequence in an unknown sample and express the final results as an absolute value (e.g., viral load, PFUs, or copies/mL) on the basis of concentration of standard samples and can be used in viral load, vaccine, and antiviral drug studies.

RT-PCR assay for detection of Lassa virus and related Old World arenaviruses targeting the L gene,2007,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,"Vieth, S. and Drosten, C. and Lenz, O. and Vincent, M. and Omilabu, S. and Hass, M. and Becker-Ziaja, B. and ter Meulen, J. and Nichol, S. T. and Schmitz, H. and Gunther, S.","This study describes an RT-PCR assay targeting the L RNA segment of arenaviruses. Conserved regions were identified in the polymerase domain of the L gene on the basis of published sequences for Lassa virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Pichinde virus and Tacaribe virus, as well as 15 novel sequences for Lassa virus, LCMV, Ippy virus, Mobala virus and Mopeia virus determined in this study. Using these regions as target sites, a PCR assay for detection of all known Old World arenaviruses was developed and optimized. The concentration that yields 95% positive results in a set of replicate tests (95% detection limit) was determined to be 4290 copies of Lassa virus L RNA per ml of serum, corresponding to 30 copies per reaction. The ability of the assay to detect various Old World arenaviruses was demonstrated with in vitro transcribed RNA, material from infected cell cultures and samples from patients with Lassa fever and monkeys with LCMV-associated callitrichid hepatitis. The L gene PCR assay may be applicable: (i) as a complementary diagnostic test for Lassa virus and LCMV; (ii) to identify unknown Old World arenaviruses suspected as aetiological agents of disease; and (iii) for screening of potential reservoir hosts for unknown Old World arenaviruses. √Ç¬© 2007 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",Include,Maybe,Maybe,>1
Recent isolations of Lassa virus from Nigerian rodents,1975,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Wulff, H. and Fabiyi, A. and Monath, T. P.","Rodents were trapped in the Benue Plateau and North Eastern States of Nigeria where Lassa fever had been reported in previous years. Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident. Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was herefore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.",Include,Include,Include,3
